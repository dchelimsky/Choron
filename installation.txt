Problems I ran into while installing this on the netbook
(which is probably indicative of the install process):
--Need to install rvm, ruby1.9.3, rubygems, and rails.
--Bullshit with "RVM is not a function" happening over and over - HAPPENS WHEN YOU ARE IN A SCREEN. Script to fix it involves adding some RVM junk to your path - maybe check the RVM website for this. (The startup script should handle it though)
--RVM problems switching to ruby 1.9.3. Make sure to use rvm with rails option.
Make sure to install ruby 1.9.3. Make sure to install with openssl support
(may need to reinstall ruby1.9.3 with rvm if you get this error).
--Need for an execjs - need node.js or something else installed.
--Make sure to run bundle install before trying to run the server.
--Need to have the database setup and all the information from it.
--If you get "initialization_dup" bullshit errors, the server is running on ruby 2.0.0. Quit, switch to ruby 1.9.3 with rvm, and restart.
--(Was a problem on my laptop, not the server netbook) If you get horrible errors about "rake aborted: couldn't find table 'settings,'" you need to go to config/initializers/params.rb and comment out all of the code in that file. (It is trying to use stuff from the Settings table before that table exists)

NOTE FOR BACKUP SYSTEM:
--Dropbox daemon needs to be started in a screen of its own

Other problems:
unknown attribute: queue
--Run rails generate delayed_job:upgrade
--Then run rake db:migrate
