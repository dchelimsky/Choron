NECESSARY THINGS
Make chore scheduler
  Make a form to access and delete recurring chores
  Change chore scheduler to update run time when it changes stuff
Make bounties work
Make 'admin access' or require user to type 'I solemnly swear I am not about to be a dick' 
  before doing certain tasks
Make user-friendly way to delete chore schedulers (delete them when you delete the chore, for example)
Make 'Back' buttons not go to stupid places
Add a function to sort bids from least objectionable to most objectionable
  When you're in debt, it will bid on the least objectionable 
  at the  amount required to turn it to second least objectionable.
Needs some scheduling stuff; 
  maybe 1 day after you go into debt, if you're still in debt, it will force your EV positive?
  Whenever a bid is placed and there are debtors, 
  it should re-evaluate their status and make sure to keep their EV positive.
Add a system for creating bounties

SEMI-NECESSARY THINGS
Descriptions of chores
Remove buttons:
  Edit auction expiration date
  Make auction next to each chore (or fix)
  New chore without an auction
  New auction from existing chore
Figure out "Make chore and auction at same time" form
Refactor chore market list into a partial
Add something that cleans out a user's bid preferences
Delete stupid pages (chores list etc.)

NICE THINGS
Remove 'new chore' button from My Chores
Set up helper script to run app and DelayedJob worker with one command
Fix all the gross Back buttons
Write validator for auctions to make sure there is an expiration job
  Delete related expiration jobs on deletion?
Write validator for delayed jobs to make sure it can do stuff? (idk, maybe when you do Object.delay.function() put that in? not sure how to do this)
Make logout button not a tab
Setup 'delete excess expired chores' functionality
Add validators to everything

Feature req: Persisting chore name/description after deletion
  (i.e. "Do you want to use one of these previous chore names?")
