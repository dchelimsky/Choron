NECESSARY THINGS


SEMI-NECESSARY THINGS
Remove buttons:
  Edit auction expiration date
  Make auction next to each chore (or fix)
Figure out "Make chore and auction at same time" form

NICE THINGS
Set up helper script to run app and DelayedJob worker with one command
Fix all the gross Back buttons
Write validator for auctions to make sure there is an expiration job
Write validator for delayed jobs to make sure it can do stuff? (idk, maybe when you do Object.delay.function() put that in? not sure how to do this)
Make logout button not a tab
